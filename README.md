# Summary of the PowerPoint Presentation: Heatmap Comparison

The presentation outlines the process and requirements for implementing heatmaps in an application designed to monitor and display the distribution of water on greens. Below is a detailed summary of the key points discussed:

## Initial Setup of Boxes:

        Boxes are placed at a distance of 3 meters from the edge of the green.
        Additional boxes are placed at 3-meter intervals, resulting in a grid of boxes.

## User Input in the App:

        Users can specify the area of the boxes, which are indicated as green boxes in the app.
        Each box is assigned a number, and users can enter the value (water measurement) for each box.

## Contour Creation:
    
        A line is drawn around the corners of the boxes to recreate the contour of the green.
        This line is then transformed into a "spline" (smoothed line without edges).
        The final contour of the green is exported.

## Value Entry and Interpolation:

        The values entered by the user for each box are used to interpolate and display a heatmap.
        The heatmap visually represents the distribution of water across the green, with colors ranging from red (low readings) to yellow, green, and dark green (high readings).

## Color Scheme and Display:
    
        The color scheme is crucial: red indicates low values, while green indicates high values.
        The heatmap should only display colors and the contour of the green, focusing on the relevant area with measured values.
        Cells that do not have data should not be colored.

## Comparison and Examples:

        Examples of interpolated heatmaps are provided to show the desired outcome.
        Comparison between high and low values helps to visualize the effectiveness of the heatmap.

## Implementation Plan

Based on the summary and the requirements discussed in the presentation, here is a step-by-step plan to implement the heatmaps:

### Box Placement and User Input:

        Ensure the app allows users to define the area for each box and enter water measurement values.
        Assign numbers to each box for easy identification.

### Contour Creation:

        Implement functionality to draw a line around the corners of the boxes.
        Convert this line into a smooth spline to represent the contour of the green.
        Allow exporting of the contour for further use.

### Heatmap Generation:

        Use the entered values to interpolate and generate a heatmap.
        Apply the correct color scheme to the heatmap, with red for low values and green for high values.

### Display Adjustments:

        Ensure the heatmap only displays the relevant area with measured values.
        Avoid coloring cells without data to keep the visualization clean and accurate.

### Testing and Validation:

        Test the heatmap generation with various data inputs to ensure accuracy.
        Validate the color scheme and contour representation against the examples provided in the presentation.
